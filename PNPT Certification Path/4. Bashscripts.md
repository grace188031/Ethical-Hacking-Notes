## Creating bash script ipsweep.sh

```
mousepad ipsweep.sh
chmod u+x ipsweep.sh

#!/bin/bash

if [ "$1" == ""]
then
echo "You forgot an IP address!"
echo "Syntax: ./ipsweep.sh 192.168.2"

else
for ip in `seq 1 254`; do
ping -c 1 $1$.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " f4; tr -d ":" & done
fi
```
What do you mean by $1? For example if you want to execute ./ipsweep.sh
```
./ipsweep.sh 192.168.2
```
The ./ipsweep.sh is $0 and 192.168.4 is $1 argument

## Nmap

```
for ip in $(cat ips.txt); do nmap -T4 -pN -A $ip; done
```
