## Common exploited ports


From the scanning with nmap here are the open ports

`80,443,445` - those commonly found with exploits
smb related expoits is often

Might also check http://192.168.68.6/admin - might see something there
# Investigate the port 80 and 443 first

1. Now turn on your burp suite and access the kioptrix site
	- http://192.168.68.6
	![Alt](../Images/kioptrix_site.png)

Checking some links there leads 404 redirection to Not Found. WE can see some relevant information

2. Create Notes
	- 80/443 - 192.168.68.6 - 6:32 PM
	- Default webpage - Apache - PHP
	- Information Disclosure - 404 page
	- Information Disclosure - server headers disclose version info
	- 80/tcp    open  http        Apache httpd 1.3.20 ((Unix)  (Red-Hat/Linux) mod_ssl/2.8.4 OpenSSL/0.9.6b)
	- mod_ssl/2.8.4 - mod_ssl 2.8.7 and lower are vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow which may allow a remote shell.
	- Webalizer version 2.01 (http://192.168.68.6/usage/usage_200909.html)
	
3. Perform Vulnerability Scanning called **nikto**. It s a great tool. `nikto --help`

```
nikto -h https://192.168.68.6
```
```
nikto -h http://192.168.68.6
```

Here is the result

```
