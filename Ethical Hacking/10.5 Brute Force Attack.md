# Brute Force Attack


1. Use Hydra

```
hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt

```

I encountered issue in running hydra. First is the incompatibility with the cipher used, so I edited the /etc/ssh/ssh_config to accept old ciphers

From https://medium.com/@sany4sec/ssh-error-in-hydra-while-brute-forcing-b148a61752e2 - I added the following key exchange

```
Host *  
  Ciphers +3des-cbc,aes128-cbc,aes192-cbc,aes256-cbc  
  KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1  
  HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa,ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com,ssh-dss,ssh-dss-cert-v01@openssh.com  
  PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa,ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com,ssh-dss,ssh-dss-cert-v01@openssh.com
```

After that it runs to Out of Memory Error. It turns out that I need to execute the stephs here in this link
