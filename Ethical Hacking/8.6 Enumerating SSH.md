## SSH Enumeration

Current notes after enumerating HTTP and SMB. Now we will add the SSH here

	- 80/443 - 192.168.68.6 - 6:32 PM
	- Default webpage - Apache - PHP
	- Information Disclosure - 404 page
	- Information Disclosure - server headers disclose version info
	- 80/tcp    open  http        Apache httpd 1.3.20 ((Unix)  (Red-Hat/Linux) mod_ssl/2.8.4 OpenSSL/0.9.6b)
	- mod_ssl/2.8.4 - mod_ssl 2.8.7 and lower are vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow which may allow a remote shell.
	- Webalizer version 2.01 (http://192.168.68.6/usage/usage_200909.html)
	- SMB 
		- Unix (Samba 2.2.1a)
	- SSH
		- OpenSSH 2.9p2

1. Try to connect to the machine using ssh
	- Since this is an old server, its using old key exchange which restricts us to connect
```
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~]
└─# ssh 192.168.68.6
Unable to negotiate with 192.168.68.6 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1

```

To connect using the old key exchange use the `-oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1` 
Dont forget to specify the Hostkey algorithm and cipher
