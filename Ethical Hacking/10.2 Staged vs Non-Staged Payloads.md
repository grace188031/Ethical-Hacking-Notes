# Staged vs Non-Staged Payloads

Payload - we run as exploit

## Non-staged

- Sends exploit shellcode all at once
- Larger in size and wont always work
	- Example:
		-windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp

## Staged

- Sends payload in stages
- Can be less stable
	- Example:
		-windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
