##Creating bash script ipsweep.sh

```
nano ipsweep.sh

#!/bin/bash

for ip in `seq 1 254`; do
ping -c 1 $1$.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " f4; tr -d ":" & done
```
What do you mean by $1? For example if you want to execute ./ipsweep.sh
```
./ipsweep.sh 192.168.2
```
The ./ipsweep.sh is $0 and 192.168.4 is $1 argument
