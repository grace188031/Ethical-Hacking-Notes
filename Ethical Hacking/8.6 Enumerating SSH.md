1. Try to connect to the machine using ssh
	- Since this is an old server, its using old key exchange which restricts us to connect
```
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~]
└─# ssh 192.168.68.6
Unable to negotiate with 192.168.68.6 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1

```

To connect using the old key exchange use the `-oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`
